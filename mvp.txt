Project Title:  Car Rental Availability
Team Members:  Robert, Clayton, Kevin
Project Description: Provide a website for customers to locate and book automobile rentals
API to be used:  Expedia, Orbitz, Travel, Cars (not sure exactly which will be chosen for to use at this time)



With your group, answer each of the following questions:

Who is your target audience?  anyone looking to rent a car.
What is the problem that the product will address?  locates available car rentals from various companies. showing rates an locations.
What is the primary goal of the product?  search
Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
 - user enters relevant data and performs search. results to provide price, location, and type of car
 - user may book the best result 


Remember, your MVP should be the absolute minimum product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:

As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.
As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of Images.
As a user, I want to be able to view other people's Images so that I can keep up with what's happening in their lives.
Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should not be part of the MVP.
